According to [WIPO decision](http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=D2017-1828), Rubicon Communications/Netgate used opnsense.com
domain name to discredit the Deciso Group B.V. competing products (OPNsense) and disrupt their business and
derive an indirect illegitimate commercial advantage.

So, Netgate (who did not hesitate to [sue](http://eu.adr.eu/adr/decisions/decision.php?dispute_id=7162) because of empty pfsense.eu website that's been parked for 10 years) 
"inconspicuously" registers opnsense.com domain and creates a [website](http://web.archive.org/web/20160314132836/http://www.opnsense.com/) there for illegal competition purposes, hiding behind a proxy registrar and his wife's skirt and claiming "parody" as defence.

And what's [@gonzo's](https://twitter.com/gonzopancho) final [take on this stunt](https://twitter.com/gonzopancho/status/933447092999217152)? Caught red-handed, will he own up to this at least?

Yeah sure, must have been your wife a.k.a. Netgate's CEO. Really classy family business, Sir...
